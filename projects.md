## Current Projects
### [takemy.cards](https://takemy.cards)
Online business cards that load fast and kick arse. [Here's mine.](https://takemy.cards/oofdere)

### [kusojisho](https://kusojisho.moe)
One-page, searchable, static glossary.

### [kvcm.live](https://kvcm.live)
The third iteration of my school's campus radio station. I facilitated the move to a fully remote format, building the website and stream.

## Pending Reboot
### [Heatchess](https://heatchess.com)
Chess. But with heatmaps. And hopefully less `if` statements this time.

### [Media Disclosures](https://disclosures.media)
An open-source, always evolving, universal content rating system. Needs a website rewrite. I expect to have this done by the end of March.

## Shelved Projects
### [Broadcasting 42](https://github.com/oofdere/b42)
A set of open-source self-taught courses to get people into creating and distributing media. Pending me learning how to teach.
