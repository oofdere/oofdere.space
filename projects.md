## Current Projects

Art sharing platform living on the bleeding edge, putting artists before anyone (or any thing) else! Please join!

### [takemy.cards](https://takemy.cards)
Online business cards that load fast and kick arse. [Here's mine.](https://takemy.cards/oofdere)

### [kvcm.live](https://kvcm.live)
The third iteration of my school's campus radio station. I facilitated the move to a fully remote format, building the website and stream.

## Coming Soon (maybe)

### Psychology

### Field

## Pending Reboot

### Anketto
A generic polling website, that I'll be making into a tool for streamers to run polls with during streams.

## Shelved Projects
### [Broadcasting 42](https://github.com/oofdere/b42)
A set of open-source self-taught courses to get people into creating and distributing media. Pending me learning how to teach.

### [Heatchess](https://heatchess.com)

An open-source, always evolving, universal content rating system.
